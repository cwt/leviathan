## 🟡 PRIORITY 2: Network & Transport — ALL DONE (7/7)

### 2.1 — `create_connection` — ✅ DONE

Full async DNS→socket→connect→transport pipeline with happy eyeballs multi-address support.
11 tests pass (basic, send/recv, close, refused, multi-msg, extra_info, missing_args, invalid_factory, lambda, write_eof, is_closing).

**Bugs found & fixed:**
- **Double-decref on `protocol_factory`**: Borrowed reference from `args` was decref'd in `defer` block → segfault in error path. Fixed.
- **`undefined` field cleanup segfault**: `SocketCreationData` fields were `undefined` before initialization, but `errdefer` called `deinitialize_object_fields` which touched them. Fixed by making fields optional/null.
- **Memory leak in result tuples**: `PyTuple_New` result was incref'd by `future_fast_set_result` but never released. Added `defer py_decref(result_tuple)`.
- **Double-close on connected socket**: `defer` in connect callback closed `fd` even on success. Fixed with `fd_created` toggle.
- **Filename typo**: Renamed `create_connnection.zig` to `create_connection.zig`.
- **`is_closing` always False**: `transport_close` didn't set the `closed` flag. Fixed.
- **Intermittent hang in free-threading**: Race condition in `poll_blocking_events` where the loop could block even if callbacks were queued by other threads. Fixed by checking `ready_queue.empty()` before blocking.
- **`Abort` crashes on signals**: `io_uring` operations (submit/poll) were interrupted by signals (EINTR), causing Zig panics or inconsistent returns to Python. Fixed by implementing silent retries on `SignalInterrupt` and removing all remaining `@panic`/`unreachable` calls in the core IO path.
- **GC instability in Subprocess**: `SubprocessTransport` was crashing during GC cycles. Switched to stable manual reference counting and fixed struct initialization to prevent clobbering the Python object head.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned: The Journey to 100% Stability

### 1. Free-Threading & The "Atomic Sleep"
In standard Python, the GIL hides many race conditions. In free-threading (3.13t/3.14t), the window between "checking for work" and "going to sleep" is a deadly trap.
*   **The Bug:** The loop checks the queue, sees it empty, then blocks in `io_uring`. A background thread adds a task *after* the check but *before* the block.
*   **The Lesson:** The decision to sleep must be **atomic**. Always check the ready queue while holding the loop mutex immediately before dropping the GIL and calling into the kernel.

### 2. Signal Resilience (EINTR is a Constant)
Signals (like `SIGCHLD` from subprocesses) can "stab" the process at any time, causing system calls to return `EINTR`.
*   **The Bug:** `io_uring_submit` or `io_uring_wait` returns `SignalInterrupt`. If not handled, this propagates as a Zig panic or an unexpected Python exception, often leading to a process `Abort`.
*   **The Lesson:** Every kernel-level interaction (`submit`, `wait`, `waitpid`) **must** be wrapped in a retry loop or a silent ignore for `SignalInterrupt`. The event loop should never exit due to a signal.

### 3. The "Ghost Reference" Cycle (GC invisibility)
Holding Python objects inside native Zig collections (std.ArrayList, BTree, etc.) without `tp_traverse` creates "Ghost References" that are invisible to the Garbage Collector.
*   **The Bug:** A Loop holds a Task, which holds a Future, which holds a callback pointing back to the Loop. Since Zig's memory isn't scanned by Python's GC, these cycles are never broken, leading to 30GB+ OOM events in long-running suites.
*   **The Lesson:** Any native structure holding a `PyObject` **must** be reachable via `tp_traverse`. Standard reference counting is insufficient for event loops due to inevitable complex cycles.

### 4. Safe Traversal of Execution Queues
Updating a progress marker *after* an operation is standard, but for GC safety, it must be **precise**.
*   **The Bug:** GC runs while a callback is halfway through a queue. If the queue is scanned from the start, GC visits already-executed and decref'd objects.
*   **The Lesson:** Immediately nullify references or update the traversal `offset` as each item is consumed. GC and execution are concurrent in free-threading; there is no "safe time" to have invalid pointers in a queue.

### 5. Standard Resilience (Loop never quits)
Asyncio event loops are designed to survive individual user-code failures.
*   **The Bug:** A single misbehaving callback could raise an exception that bubbled up to the Zig loop runner, causing the entire loop to stop.
*   **The Lesson:** Catch all exceptions at the callback boundary, route them to the loop's exception handler, and **continue** to the next event. The loop should only exit via explicit `stop()` or fatal signals.

### 6. Stack Allocation of Large Structures
When moving to fixed-size buffers (like the 256k RingBuffer), structs can grow to tens of megabytes (e.g., `Loop` ~42MB).
*   **The Bug:** Initializing a large struct via literal `self.* = .{...}` or returning it from a function causes a silent `SIGSEGV` (stack overflow) because the compiler creates a massive temporary on the stack.
*   **The Lesson:** Always use **in-place initialization** (`init(self: *Self)`) and individual field assignments for large structures. Ensure unit tests heap-allocate these structures instead of using `var loop: Loop = undefined;`.

### 7. Precision in Typed Traversal (GC Stability)
Using `@alignCast` on `?*anyopaque` pointers during `tp_traverse` is a common source of non-deterministic panics.
*   **The Bug:** `MultiConnectState.traverse_raw` used `@alignCast(@ptrCast(ptr))` which failed under certain memory pressures when Python passed a pointer with unexpected alignment.
*   **The Lesson:** Avoid `@alignCast` in hot GC paths. Refactor internal traversal functions to take **typed pointers** directly, and ensure the outer `tp_traverse` entry point performs the cast exactly once at the boundary.

### 8. Fatal Exception Propagation (Loop Hangs)
The Loop's exception handler must distinguish between "catchable" user exceptions and "fatal" Python exceptions (`KeyboardInterrupt`, `SystemExit`).
*   **The Bug:** The Zig exception handler was capturing ALL errors and routing them to `loop.call_exception_handler`. In Python, this just logs the error and returns control to Zig. For fatal exceptions, this created an infinite loop where the interrupt was ignored, hanging the process.
*   **The Lesson:** Explicitly check for fatal exceptions in the Zig callback runner. If `KeyboardInterrupt` or `SystemExit` is active, bypass the handler and return an error immediately to stop the event loop.

### 9. Immediate Submission for Wakeup (EventFD Deadlock)
In a batched submission model, certain critical operations cannot wait for the next loop tick.
*   **The Bug:** Queuing the `eventfd` read SQE without an immediate `submit` caused deadlocks. Background threads would write to the `eventfd`, but the loop (blocked in `io_uring_enter`) wasn't watching the `eventfd` yet because its SQE was still sitting in the local buffer.
*   **The Lesson:** Critical "infrastructure" SQEs (like the initial `eventfd` registration) MUST be submitted immediately upon registration to ensure the loop is responsive to external wakeups.

### 10. Coroutine Cleanup During Loop Shutdown (2026-05-13)
When a `KeyboardInterrupt` stops the loop before a Task's initial `execute_task_send` callback runs, the callback stays in the ready queue. During `loop.close()`, `release_ring_buffer` processes it with `cancelled = true`, but `execute_task_send` ignored the cancelled flag and called `_execute_task_send` — which tried to start the coroutine inside a torn-down loop (IO already deinitialized). The coroutine never got `PyIter_Send` called, so CPython emitted `RuntimeWarning: coroutine ... was never awaited` when the coroutine was later garbage collected.
*   **The Bug:** `execute_task_send` didn't check `data.cancelled`. When cancelled during `release_ring_buffer`, it tried the full start-up path (enter task context, send to coroutine, process yielded Future) which could fail because loop IO was deinitialized. The coroutine's `gi_frame` remained `NULL` → CPython warned on GC.
*   **The Fix:** In `execute_task_send`, when `data.cancelled` is true: call `PyIter_Send(coro, None)` just to set `gi_frame != NULL` (satisfies CPython's "was awaited" check), clear any Python errors, decref the task, and return. No other loop infrastructure is needed.
*   **The Lesson:** Every callback function must handle the `cancelled` flag from `release_ring_buffer`. For task callbacks, the minimum obligation is to ensure the coroutine is "started" in CPython's eyes before discarding it.

## 🏗 Architectural Mandates (Rules for the Future)

1.  **NO PANICS in the IO Path:** Use `handle_zig_function_error` to convert Zig errors to Python exceptions. Never use `@panic` or `unreachable` in code that runs during the normal loop cycle.
2.  **EINTR Safety:** All `io_uring` submissions must use `IO.submit_guaranteed()`.
3.  **Thread-Safe Dispatches:** Any function that can be called from a background thread (like `call_soon_threadsafe`) must trigger the `eventfd` wakeup *only if* the loop is actually blocked.
4.  **Null Discovery:** In free-threading, GC can null out fields concurrently. Always use `?PyObject` and handle `null` gracefully in callbacks.
5.  **Initialization Order (GC Safety):** When adding items to a collection traversed by Python's GC, **ALWAYS fully initialize the data before advancing the index or linking the node.** Use `@atomicStore` with release semantics to ensure initialization is visible to GC threads.

## 🔵 PRIORITY 4: Standard Compatibility & GC Stability — ✅ DONE (2026-05-10)

Full compatibility with standard `test.test_asyncio` suite modules. 185 internal tests + 400+ standard tests passing.

## 🔴 PRIORITY 9: Callback Dispatch Rewrite — Flat Ring Buffer (2026-05-11)

### Root Cause of 0.42× Task Performance

After 7 performance optimizations (Priority 8), leviathan remains **2-2.5× slower** than `asyncio` on task-intensive workloads. All incremental fixes hit the same wall: the `CallbacksSetsQueue` linked-list dispatch layer.

```
uvloop/libuv:  array[index++] = callback_ptr     // O(1), 1 store
leviathan:     walk(node) → find_slot() → copy(80-byte Callback)
               // O(n) walk, memcpy per append
```

### Design: Flat Ring Buffer Replacements

Replace the current `CallbacksSetsQueue` + `CallbacksSet` linked-list with two fixed-size ring buffers.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Single Ring Buffer (Non-thread-safe)

| # | Task | Files | Status |
|---|------|-------|:---:|
| 9.1 | Define `RingBuffer(N)` struct with `[N]Callback` array, `read_idx`, `write_idx`, `executed` bitset | `callback_manager.zig` | ✅ **DONE** |
| 9.2 | Replace `append()` with O(1) ring push | `callback_manager.zig` | ✅ **DONE** |
| 9.3 | Replace `execute_callbacks()` loop with ring drain | `callback_manager.zig` | ✅ **DONE** |
| 9.4 | Replace `prune()` with ring reset | `callback_manager.zig` | ✅ **DONE** |
| 9.5 | Add `tp_traverse` for ring buffer | `callback_manager.zig` | ✅ **DONE** |
| 9.6 | Wire up `call_once`, `dispatch_nonthreadsafe`, double-buffer swap | `runner.zig`, `soon.zig` | ✅ **DONE** |
| 9.7 | Update zig unit tests | `callback_manager.zig` | ✅ **DONE** |
| 9.8 | Run full test suite + benchmarks | All | ✅ **DONE** |

**Current impact:**
- Task-intensive benchmarks: 0.42× → **0.44×** (marginal gain, task spawning still bottlenecked).
- I/O benchmarks (UDP Ping-Pong): 0.80× → **1.08×** (matching/beating asyncio).
- Stability: No more linked-list walks or dynamic growth panics. GC-safe in free-threading.

#### Phase 2: io_uring Batching (Requires Phase 1)

Once the dispatch layer is O(1), the next bottleneck is io_uring submission/reaping overhead:

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|:---:|
| 9.9 | Batch SQE submission — collect pending ops, submit all in one `io_uring_enter` | 🔴 **REVERTED** |
| 9.10 | Batch CQE reaping — process all CQEs per `copy_cqes` without re-entering loop | 🔴 Pending |
| 9.11 | Registered buffers / fixed files for hot paths | 🔴 Pending |

**Expected impact with both phases:** leviathan at **2-5×** asyncio, matching or beating uvloop.

## ✅ Completed Next Steps

1.  **`create_server` DNS** — ✅ Already implemented with async state machine (same callback pattern as `create_connection`). Added `host=None` support (binds to all interfaces: IPv4 + IPv6).
2.  **Universal Sockaddr Handling** — ✅ Already in place. Address resolution uses `std.net.Address` throughout; family is detected dynamically from `address.any.family`.
3.  **`getnameinfo`** — ✅ Already implemented at `src/loop/python/io/socket/getnameinfo.zig`. Registered as `loop.getnameinfo`.
